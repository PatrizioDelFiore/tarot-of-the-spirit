        <h2>Pick a card</h2>
        <p>
          This tarot deck is used differently from all others and has the unique characteristic of being a “self-reading” deck.
          It requires no knowledge of how tarot works and does not include any accompanying “manual.”<br /><br />
          You simply place the cards in front of you, bring your hands together at the center of your chest in a gesture of inner reflection,
          and mentally ask a question. Then you draw one card… then another… as long as you still have questions.<br /><br />
          Happy reading to everyone from Patrizio Fiorenza!
