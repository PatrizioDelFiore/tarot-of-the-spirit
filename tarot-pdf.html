          THE IMAGES OF THIS DECK WERE CREATED WITH THE ASSISTANCE OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE UNDER MY ARTISTIC DIRECTION, THROUGH A CAREFUL AND POETIC RESEARCH OF GENERATION PROMPTS BASED ON MACHINE LEARNING.
        </p>
        <p>
          EACH TEXT WAS PERSONALLY WRITTEN, DRAWING INSPIRATION FROM THE MASTERS RAMANA MAHARSHI AND ECKHART TOLLE, THUS TRANSFORMING EVERY CARD INTO A SMALL INDIVIDUAL WORK OF ART.
        </p>
