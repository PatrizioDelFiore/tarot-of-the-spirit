        <h2>Author Bio</h2>

        <p>
          My name is <strong>Patrizio Fiorenza</strong>, born in Rome on July 8th, 1990.
          Since childhood, I have been drawn to spirituality—an inner curiosity that
          has accompanied me quietly but steadily through every stage of my life.
        </p>

        <p>
          Along with this sensitivity, I have always felt a natural attraction toward
          art and literature. Yet life led me down a different professional path:
          working at the <strong>Bank of Italy</strong> as a statistician. Although this world
          may seem far from spiritual exploration, it gifted me discipline, clarity,
          and a way of observing patterns—skills that later became essential to my
          creative and inner journey.
        </p>

        <p>
          Today, I try to bring together both sides of my nature. I use the analytical
          tools and precision learned in my professional life to share, with sincerity
          and dedication, the spiritual texts and experiences that have shaped me.
          At the same time, I am reclaiming the artistic and expressive dimension
          that has always belonged to me.
        </p>

        <p>
          <em>Tarot of the Spirit</em> is one of the spaces where these two worlds meet:
          intuition and structure, inspiration and method, coming together with a
          single purpose — to illuminate, uplift, and guide.

          THE IMAGES OF THIS DECK WERE CREATED WITH THE ASSISTANCE OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE UNDER MY ARTISTIC DIRECTION, THROUGH A CAREFUL AND POETIC RESEARCH OF GENERATION PROMPTS BASED ON MACHINE LEARNING.

        <p>
          EACH TEXT WAS PERSONALLY WRITTEN, DRAWING INSPIRATION FROM THE MASTERS RAMANA MAHARSHI AND ECKHART TOLLE, THUS TRANSFORMING EVERY CARD INTO A SMALL INDIVIDUAL WORK OF ART.
